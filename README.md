## How it works?

Orange was created to be a simple and practical package manager, integrating lowdb and express in a clean way, the terminal waits for the user to open the browser and then asks the user to indicate which type of application he wants to view, if the package exists he will show it to "localhost: 3000"


As orange uses the same system and database as lemon, you can place your packages on it when the final version becomes available, go to [Lemon](https://github.com/Juice-Team/lemon)
